# iii) Conclusion for results

#At the 5% significance level (α = 0.05), the p-value is greater than 0.05, so we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
#This means the data do not show a significant difference from equal snack perference - customers apper to chooseA, B, C, and D roughly equally.
#However, at the 10% level (α = 0.10), the p-value is slightly smaller than 0.10, which suggests weak or marginal evidence that customers may perfer some snacks more than others.
